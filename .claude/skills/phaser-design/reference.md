# Phaser Design — Reference Guide

Reference material for the phaser-design skill. Consult this file during implementation phases when you need asset catalogs, code examples, or detailed technical guidance.

## Design Philosophy

A 2D virtual office is a **spatial metaphor for teamwork**. Unlike a plain status dashboard, it communicates:

- **Presence** — agents occupy physical space, they're *there*
- **Activity** — animations and desk state show who's working, idle, or done
- **Personality** — furniture, decorations, and layout choices create *culture*
- **Spatial relationships** — proximity implies collaboration; zones imply function

### What Makes a Great Virtual Office

GREAT OFFICE = functional zones + visual density + small details + warm lighting + lived-in clutter

**Functional zones** — not just a grid of desks. Real offices have:
- Work area (desks, monitors, chairs)
- Social area (couch, coffee table, plants)
- Wall decorations (whiteboards, clocks, posters, bookshelves)
- Transition elements (rugs defining zones, plants as dividers)

**Visual density** — empty space is the enemy. Every 3x3 tile area should have *something*:
- Corner plants, floor cushions, trash cans
- Wall posters, clocks, bulletin boards
- Cables, mugs, books, backpacks on or near desks

**Small details** — the magic that makes pixel art feel alive:
- A rug under the couch area, not floating on bare floor
- Plants in corners where walls meet
- A coffee machine or water cooler near the social area
- Bookshelves against the wall, not floating mid-room

**Lived-in clutter** — sterile = boring. Add:
- Books stacked on shelves, not perfectly aligned
- Multiple plant varieties (not the same plant repeated)
- Mixed furniture styles (not every desk identical)

## Rendering Pipeline

```
OfficeScene.preload()
  → Load all sprites from public/assets/ (desks, avatars, furniture)

OfficeScene.create()
  → RoomBuilder.build(roomW, roomH)
    → drawFloor()       // Graphics: wood base + checkerboard pattern
    → drawWalls()       // Graphics: wall color + baseboard trim
    → placeFurniture()  // Sprites: wall decorations + floor items
  → For each agent: new AgentSprite(scene, x, y, character, variant, agent)
    → Desk sprite (black/white × idle/coding)
    → Avatar sprite (character poses × 0.5 scale)
    → Name badge + status dot (Graphics)
    → Animation timer (talk/blink/wave cycles)
  → Camera: zoom to fit room, center
```

---

## Animation System

| Status | Animation | Cycle |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `working` / `delivering` | talk ↔ blink | 500ms alternating |
| `done` | wave1 ↔ wave2 (4 frames) → hold blink | 400ms × 4, then static |
| `idle` | occasional talk → blink | random 2-4s intervals, 200ms talk |

### Animation Principles

- **Subtle > dramatic** — small movements (blink, occasional talk) feel alive without being distracting
- **Random intervals** — use `delay: 2000 + Math.random() * 2000` to avoid synchronized animations
- **Status-driven** — animation reflects agent state, not just decoration
- **Finite sequences** — "done" wave plays 4 frames then stops (don't loop forever)

## Asset Integration Workflow

When adding new assets from the library:

```bash
# 1. Browse available assets
ls temp/pixel-assets/town/assets/ | grep -i "plant"

# 2. Copy to dashboard public folder
cp "temp/pixel-assets/town/assets/monstera.png" dashboard/public/assets/furniture/

# 3. Register in assetKeys.ts
# Add key to FURNITURE_KEYS and path to FURNITURE_PATHS

# 4. Place in RoomBuilder.ts placeFurniture()
# Use Y-based depth sorting

# 5. Test in browser — verify positioning and depth
```

### Asset Naming Convention

Files in `dashboard/public/assets/`:

```
assets/
  desks/       desktop_set_{color}_down_{state}.png
  furniture/   {item_name}.png (lowercase, underscores)
  avatars/     {CharacterName}_{pose}.png
```

Keys in assetKeys.ts:

```
// Furniture keys: descriptive, snake_case-ish
FURNITURE_KEYS = { bookshelf: 'furniture_bookshelf', ... }

// Desk keys: variant + state
DESK_KEYS = { blackIdle: 'desk_black_idle', ... }
```

---

## Room Sizing & Dynamic Layout

The room auto-sizes based on agent count:

```js
const roomW = maxCol * CELL_W + MARGIN * 2;
const roomH = maxRow * CELL_H + MARGIN * 2 + WALL_H + loungeSpace;
```

When placing furniture, use relative positions:
- `roomW / 2` for centered items
- `MARGIN / 2` for corner items
- `roomW / N` for evenly spaced wall decorations
- `deskAreaBottom + offset` for lounge zone items

---

## Camera & Viewport

The camera auto-fits the room:

```js
const scaleX = cam.width / roomW;
const scaleY = cam.height / roomH;
const zoom = Math.min(scaleX, scaleY, 2);  // Cap at 2x
cam.centerOn(roomW / 2, roomH / 2);
```

Keep in mind:
- Maximum zoom is 2x — sprites must look good at this scale
- Room is centered in viewport — leave breathing room at edges
- Sprites designed for 32px grid should be crisp at 1x and 2x

---

## Color & Atmosphere

Current palette (palette.ts):
- Floor: warm wood `0xc4a882` with checkerboard alt `0xb89a72`
- Wall: soft cream `0xe4d8cc` with darker trim `0xa89888`
- Background: deep dark `0x1a1420`

Rules:
- Warm tones dominate — wood, cream, earth colors
- Accent with greens (plants), blues (monitors, status), and warm yellows (lamps)
- Avoid cold greys or stark whites — everything should feel cozy
- Status colors are distinct and reserved: idle=purple, working=blue, done=green, checkpoint=orange

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Empty corners and margins | Add plants, lamps, floor cushions, small furniture |
| All identical desk variants | Alternate black/white, add desk accessories nearby |
| Furniture floating mid-room | Anchor to walls, group in zones, place rugs underneath |
| Wrong depth — items behind when they should be in front | Set depth = Y position for floor items, 0 for wall items |
| Using `setOrigin(0, 0)` for floor sprites | Use `setOrigin(0.5, 1)` — bottom-center for Y-sort correctness |
| Ignoring wall decorations | Fill the wall strip — blinds, shelves, boards, clocks, posters |
| Repeating the same plant sprite | Use plant1, plant2, plant3, monstera, succulents — variety matters |
| Adding sprites without registering in assetKeys.ts | Every sprite needs a key in `FURNITURE_KEYS` + path in `FURNITURE_PATHS` |
| Hardcoding pixel positions | Use relative positioning based on `roomW`, `MARGIN`, `WALL_H`, `CELL_*` |
| Giant sprites that don't match the 32px grid | Scale down with `setScale()` or resize the PNG to fit the tile grid |
